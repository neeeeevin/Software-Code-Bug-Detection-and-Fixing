# AI Models  

This directory contains the trained AI models and related scripts for the **Software Code Bug Detection and Fixing** project. The models are designed to detect and fix Python code errors using deep learning techniques.  

 Features  
- **Bug Detection**: Identifies syntax and logical errors in Python code.  
- **AI-driven Fixes**: Suggests corrections using a fine-tuned transformer model.  
- **Model Architecture**: Utilizes Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct with additional optimizations.  
- **Caching Mechanism**: Implements LRU caching for efficient debugging.
