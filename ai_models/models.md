# AI Models  

This directory contains the trained AI models and related scripts for the **Software Code Bug Detection and Fixing** project. The models are designed to detect and fix Python code errors using deep learning techniques.  

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- **Bug Detection**: Identifies syntax and logical errors in Python code.  
- **AI-driven Fixes**: Suggests corrections using a fine-tuned transformer model.  
- **Model Architecture**: Utilizes Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct with additional optimizations.  
- **Caching Mechanism**: Implements LRU caching for efficient debugging.  

## ðŸ“‚ Directory Structure  
- `model_weights/` â†’ Pre-trained and fine-tuned model weights.  
- `training_scripts/` â†’ Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for training and fine-tuning models.  
- `inference.py` â†’ Script to load the model and perform bug detection/fixing.  
- `requirements.txt` â†’ Dependencies for running the AI models.
